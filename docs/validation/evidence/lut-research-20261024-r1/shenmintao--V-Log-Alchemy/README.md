## 📖 Introduction

This project aims to break the "color barrier" between camera brands through mathematical means.

Many camera manufacturers (like Fujifilm, Leica, and Hasselblad) have distinctive color science, but their official LUTs and rendering pipelines typically only accept input from their own cameras. This project reverse-engineers these paths using the **ACES (Academy Color Encoding System)** workflow and recovered vendor rendering behavior:

1.  Convert Panasonic **V-Log/V-Gamut** to the standard **ACES AP0 (Linear)**.
2.  Use custom-written **DCTL (DaVinci Color Transform Language)** or high-precision matrices to perform the **inverse operation** of the target camera's IDT (Input Device Transform).
3.  Disguise the signal as the target camera's native Log/Gamut or recovered internal RGB space (e.g., F-Log2C, Leica Log, Hasselblad RGB).
4.  Apply the target manufacturer's official color LUT or the recovered rendering transform.

The resulting `.cube` files can be directly loaded into Panasonic cameras (like S1R II, S1H, S5 series) for real-time in-camera monitoring or used in post-production.

## 📂 LUT Pack Content

The original creative LUTs in this repository are designed for **Panasonic V-Log / V-Gamut** input. v1.3 adds model-specific Panasonic Standard input adapters.

### Panasonic Standard Input (globally rebuilt in v1.6)

`Luts/Panasonic-Standard/Conversion` contains 33-point `Standard -> V-Log` adapters for GH6, S5II/S5IIX, G9II, GH7, S9, S1IIE, S1RII, S1II, and DC-L10.

v1.6 replaces the pointwise Standard pseudo-inverse and v1.5 output-colour patch with one global forward-pair fit per model. Every adapter retains its own decoded Standard/V-Log maps while sharing the fixed Panasonic V-Log/V-Gamut endpoint and controlled-camera constraints. S1RII has controlled quantitative validation and S9 has matching field evidence; the remaining models still need model-matched captures.

On dual-LUT cameras, configure My Photo Style as:

```text
LUT1 = matching model *S2V.cube (Standard base)
LUT2 = an original V-Log creative LUT from this repository
```

Panasonic applies the pair as `LUT2(LUT1(image))`. Start with both opacities at 100%; lower only LUT2 to soften the look. For a single-LUT workflow, `Tools/merge_standard_luts.py` converts one or two V-Log LUTs into model-specific Standard versions. Every generated file places `#LUMIXPHOTOSTYLE STD` immediately after `TITLE`.

See [`Luts/Panasonic-Standard/README.md`](Luts/Panasonic-Standard/README.md) for model and firmware support, dual-LUT setup, derivation details, and the Standard highlight/gamut limits that cannot be recovered.

### 🟧 Hasselblad Phocus (Phocus X2D Core)
*Based on the recovered Phocus 4.0.1 X2D rendering path including the daylight color-correction stage. v1.4 replaces the former Hasselblad RGB/D50 intermediate files with display-ready Rec.709 and sRGB outputs.*

*   **`Hasselblad_Standard_Phocus_X2D_VLog_Rec709.cube` / `..._sRGB.cube`**
    *   **Style**: Hasselblad Standard, with the captured daylight Phocus `ColorCorrect` CbCr stage, highlight rolloff, and Standard film curve.
*   **`Hasselblad_Nature_Phocus_X2D_VLog_Rec709.cube` / `..._sRGB.cube`**
    *   **Style**: Hasselblad Nature, adding the captured Nature RGB gradation table for a fuller outdoor and saturated-colour response.
*   **Output choice**: use Rec.709 for camera monitoring/video and sRGB for sRGB-managed still/desktop workflows. Both are complete display transforms and need no following CST.
*   **65-point versions** of all four combinations are included for higher-precision post workflows.
*   **Daylight-baked**: the Phocus `ColorCorrect` / CbCr stage changes with white balance. The published LUTs and bundled artifact use the daylight table, which also covers the cloudy/shade range. Tungsten and warm captures are not bundled; a separately prepared artifact bundle can be selected with `--artifact`.
*   **Legacy removal**: the pre-v1.4 Hasselblad RGB/D50 intermediate LUTs were removed because they were unsuitable for ordinary direct use. They remain available from the `v1.3` tag and must not be interpreted as ACES AP1.
*   **Not emitted**: `Portrait` and `Product`, because their captured color transform matches `Standard`; their Phocus preset differences are sharpening/noise behavior that a 3D LUT cannot encode.

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. The Easy Way (For Camera / Real Time LUTs)
I have included pre-generated 33-Point Cube LUTs in the repo.

1.  Download the `.cube` files.
2.  Copy them to your camera's SD card (or use the Lumix Lab App).
3.  Load them into the LUT Library.
4.  Shoot straight-out-of-camera JPEGs or video with the selected look baked in.

### 2. The Standard Way (For DaVinci Resolve Free)
For users without the Studio version who want to apply the look in post-production:

1.  Import the provided `.cube` files to DaVinci Resolve.
2.  Workflow: V-Log -> Corrector.
3.  Drag and drop your desired LUT onto Corrector node.

> **Note**: This is simpler than the Studio workflow, but slightly less precise since it relies on a standard 33-point LUT rather than the DCTL math.

### 3. The Pro Way (For DaVinci Resolve Studio)
If you want full control in post:

1.  Use the provided `.dctl` file.
2.  Workflow: V-Log -> [CST to ACES (AP0), Linear] -> [My DCTL] -> [Target LUT], or use the provided `.cube` files directly for recovered non-ACES paths such as Hasselblad Phocus.
3.  disable Tone Mapping and White Point Adaptation on CST Node.

This gives you the flexibility to swap looks after shooting.

> **Note**: DCTL is a feature exclusive to the paid DaVinci Resolve Studio version.

### 4. For Adobe Camera RAW / Lightroom Users (Experimental)

If you can tolerate some color deviation, you can select the V-Log preset from "Profile" > "Camera Matching" in Adobe Camera RAW during import, and then apply the `.cube` file from this repository.

This approach might introduce a slight color shift, but it won't be drastic and can be fine-tuned later in post-production. Consider this a "workaround," as ACR/LR's support for video LUTs is not as native as dedicated video editing software.

## 🧮 The Math

The core of this project is a precise inverse matrix. Taking **ACES AP0 to F-Log2C** as an example, we calculated the inverse of Fujifilm's official IDT matrix:

```c
// ACES AP0 (Linear) to F-Gamut (Linear) Inverse Matrix
// Calculated based on Fujifilm F-Log2C official IDT v1.00
{
     1.18805632080277f, -0.0526707998586238f, -0.135385520944148f,
     0.000717966415014435f, 0.987967895093181f, 0.0113141384918043f,
     0.0095814146658757f, 0.00504068380666559f, 0.985377901527459f,
};
```

For detailed DCTL code, please see the `DCTL` folder.

The Hasselblad Phocus LUTs use the recovered path including the daylight color-correction stage:

```text
V-Log / V-Gamut
  -> linear V-Gamut
  -> XYZ D65
  -> Bradford D50 adaptation
  -> Hasselblad RGB
  -> Phocus daylight CbCr ColorCorrect
  -> highlight rolloff
  -> Phocus Standard film curve
  -> optional Phocus style gradation
  -> explicit Rec.709 or sRGB display conversion
```

That path is generated by [`Tools/generate_hasselblad_vlog.py`](Tools/generate_hasselblad_vlog.py).
The rendering description follows Hasselblad's HNCS emphasis on accurate colour, smooth tone and colour transitions, skin-tone continuity, film-like contrast, and consistent results from capture through Phocus.
The Phocus `ColorCorrect` / CbCr stage changes with white balance; the published LUTs bake in the bundled daylight table (which also covers cloudy/shade). A different captured table requires a separate manifest bundle selected with `--artifact`.
The generator and its SHA-256-checked numerical assets are included in the repository and use only relative paths. Its default `rec709` mode performs the Hasselblad RGB ICC TRC decode, Bradford D50-to-D65 adaptation, BT.709-primary conversion, and BT.709 OETF. `--output-space srgb` uses the same D65 primaries with the sRGB transfer function. `hasselblad-rgb` remains an explicitly named advanced intermediate mode but is not published as an end-user LUT. These are defined colourimetric conversions, not a claim to reproduce Phocus's unrecovered export gamut mapping exactly. See [`Luts/Hasselblad/README.md`](Luts/Hasselblad/README.md) for the exact output contracts and clean-checkout commands.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
1. **Physical Limitations**: While we have mathematically aligned the color spaces, the spectral response of different sensor CFAs (Color Filter Arrays) varies. This phenomenon, known as metamerism, means that under certain extreme lighting conditions (e.g., neon lights), the Panasonic's rendering may still have subtle differences from the original camera.
2. **Unofficial**: This project is not officially affiliated with Panasonic, Fujifilm, Leica, Hasselblad, ARRI, Nikon, RED, or other referenced camera manufacturers.
